<font size=5px color="blue">Direct Memory Access (DMA) is one of several methods for coordinating the timing of
data transfers between an input/output (I/O) device and the core processing unit or
memory in a computer.<br> DMA is one of the faster types of synchronization mechanisms,
generally providing significant improvement over interrupts, in terms of both latency and
throughput.<p> An I/O device often operates at a much slower speed than the core.1 DMA
allows the I/O device to access the memory directly, without using the core. DMA can
lead to a significant improvement in performance because data movement is one of the
most common operations performed in processing applications. There are several
advantages<hr></font>
